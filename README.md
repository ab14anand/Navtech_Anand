/*ER*/
1)I have designed ER using visio

/*Bulk Insert of Product*/
1)In Json format the values are getting inserted and also we do the same by XML format way as well
2)we can push more than 1 record at a time using this query or we can  update the price against the product code.
3) In same way we also do attibute mapping in a bulk way of insertion.

/*Trigger*/
After each in productmaster a trigger will be executed to maintain the update history in Product histoty table.

/*Reports*/
Attibutes are dynamic, so multiple rows will be retured against a single product.
so that can be transformed rows into a single row in  report tools.
